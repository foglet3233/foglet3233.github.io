  <h1> Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA </h1>
  <h3>History</h3>
  <p> Chattanooga, the 4th largest city in the state, is located in Southeast Tennessee near the border of Georgia at
    the junction of four interstate highways. The city has received national recognition for the renaissance of its
    beautiful downtown and redevelopment of its riverfront. The city boasts the most productive affordable housing
    program in the nation, and is notable for leveraging development funds through effective public/private
    partnerships, with significant civic involvement on the part of private foundations. Chattanooga was one of the
    first US cities to effectively use a citizen visioning process to set specific long-range goals to enrich the lives
    of residents and visitors.

  <p>
    The Chattanooga Convention and Trade Center is solidly booked by groups who return to the city year after year for a
    good time and a great facility that has recently been expanded. Public entities and private citizens worked together
    to build the 20,000 seat Max Finley Stadium completed in 1998. The city and county have developed an extensive
    greenway system which includes 5 miles of constructed riverwalk beginning downtown and meandering through the
    historic art district and several parks. The city supports a downtown shuttle fleet of zero-emission electric buses
    - manufactured here in Chattanooga - for commuters and visitors wishing to park-and-ride.</p>
